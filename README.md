# Data Structures

This repository is a curated collection of various data structure implementations, designed to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and utilizing fundamental data structures in your projects. Each data structure is implemented in a separate directory, making it easy to navigate and explore the code.

## Linked List

The `linked-list` directory contains an implementation of a singly linked list. It provides basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. The linked list is a dynamic data structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

## Stack

The `stack` directory includes an implementation of a stack data structure. It supports the fundamental stack operations: push, pop, and peek. The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and is commonly used for tasks such as expression evaluation and backtracking.

## Queue

The `queue` directory provides an implementation of a queue data structure. It offers the basic queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, and front. The queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and is often used for tasks such as breadth-first search and task scheduling.

## Binary Search Tree

The `binary-search-tree` directory contains an implementation of a binary search tree (BST). It supports operations like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder). BSTs are efficient for searching and maintain a sorted order of elements.

## Hash Table

The `hash-table` directory includes an implementation of a hash table data structure. It provides fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs using a hash function. Hash tables are commonly used for efficient lookups and caching.

## Heap

The `heap` directory offers an implementation of a heap data structure. It includes both min-heap and max-heap variants. Heaps are useful for priority queue operations and algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path.

## Graph

The `graph` directory contains an implementation of a graph data structure. It supports various graph operations, such as adding vertices and edges, breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and shortest path algorithms. Graphs are essential for modeling relationships and solving problems in various domains.

Each data structure directory includes its own README file with detailed explanations, usage instructions, and examples. Feel free to explore the code, contribute improvements, and use these implementations in your own projects.

Happy coding!
